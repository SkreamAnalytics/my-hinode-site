Our train travels from Harbourside Railway Station in Itchen Street.

After leaving the Station, you travel through the Historic Precinct, past some of Oamaru's oldest buildings and then through the old railway yard and past the site of Oamaru's first Railway Station. The train then runs along the bottom of clay cliffs, beside Oamaru's Victorian Harbour. 

At the end of the line, our terminus is the Red Sheds. These sheds, built in the 1800's, are now home to various crafts people.

The return trip is approximately half an hour, including 15 minutes to look around the Red Sheds. If we're lucky, we may have a little blue penguin in our shed for passengers to see.

If 15 minutes isn't long enough for you, you can visit Del Mar restaurant for a coffee or meal with magnificent views out over the Pacific Ocean. Across the road is the world famous Oamaru Blue Penguin Colony where NZ fur seals can often be seen up close lying on the rocks. After visiting these attractions, catch a later train back to Harbourside. Check the Timetable Page for times.
