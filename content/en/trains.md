B10

{{< image src="/img/trains/b10.jpg" class="img-fluid w-50" wrapper="text-center" >}}

B10 is a 0-4-0st steam locomotive built by Hudswell Clarke and Company in 1924 for Messrs Armstrong, Whitworth of Tauranga for the construction of the Waihi to Tauranga section of the North Island East Coast Main Trunk Railway.

In 1930, B10 was sold to Milburn Lime and Cement, just South of Dunedin. B10 worked there until 1967 when it was sold to Waitaki NZ's Pukeuri Freezing Works for $1500.

In 1989 Oamaru Steam and Rail swapped ex-NZR Dsa's 234 and 218 for B10.

B10 was Oamaru Steam and Rail's main motive power up until April 2007 when she was pulled from service for her 10 year overhaul.  B10 has since returned to service in December 2018.

B10 Current Status: Operational, awaiting boiler inspection
